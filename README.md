# About LRR

LRR (Lab Report Repository) is an online software application for posting assignments, submitting assignments and marking (re-marking) assignments.

This software was originally developed by by Mahomed Nor, a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the Zhejiang Normal University,
while he was taking a graduate course called **Advanced Software Engineering** (http://lanlab.org/course/2018f/se/homepage.html).

The LRR's project home page is at http://118.25.96.118/nor/homepage/index.html.



# Mission

Our mission is to make the learning experience great for tens of hundreds of students in the department of computer science.



# Current Status

This software has been actively used by students who took or are taking courses taught by Hui.  There are more than 200 student accounts created since its first launch.

A running instance of this software is at http://118.25.96.118/nor/

There are about 40 bugs (most being CRITICAL) that remain unresolved before LRR can hit its beta release.  See the section *The Bug Tracker* for more details.

Currently, there are a few groups (formed by students who are taking Software Project Management) working on these bugs.

# TODO

-   [SOLVED] A new user could not login immediately after sign up.

-  *Receiving email for password resetting*. Password resetting link is not always sent successfully.

-  *How assignements should be stored?*  Creating sub-directories on all student submissions course-code/semester/section-number.  (/student-number/course-code/semester/section-number/assignement-title/submission.txt)

-  *Feature request*. Editing the assignment title after uploading a new assignment (instructor).


We welcome your participation in this project.  Your participation does not have to be coding.  You could help us on ideas, suggestions, information, etc.

# How to Contribute

You need to be an invited member of *Lan Laboratory* before you can push your feature branch or bugfix branch to the central reops at https://github.com/lanlab-org 

Send Hui (lanhui at zjnu.edu.cn) an email message including your GitHub account name so that he could invite you to be a member of *Lan Laboratory*.

Currently, there are 9 members in *Lan Laboratory* (https://github.com/orgs/lanlab-org/people).

You will use the feature-branching workflow (see below) when
interacting with the central repo.  The main point of this workflow is
that you work on a branch on your local drive, push that branch to the
central repo, and create a Pull Request (i.e., Pull Me Request) at
GitHub for other people to review your changes.  When everything is
OK, then you could merge your changes to the master branch in the
central repo.

I believe that *code review* at the Pull Request stage is a very important activity for effectively improving both code quality and team quality.
